Standing alongside indigenous leaders and key members of his government, Lula has vowed to mend the years of neglect the Amazon suffered under the administration of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.\nUnder Bolsonaro’s tenure, the Amazon witnessed a staggering 75% increase in deforestation rates compared to the previous decade, marking a dark period for one of the planet’s most vital ecological treasures. The ramifications of this neglect stretch far beyond the borders of Brazil, impacting global climate balance and contributing to the ever-escalating issue of global warming.\nRecognizing the Amazon’s pivotal role in regulating the Earth’s climate, Lula’s administration has relaunched an ambitious plan of action against deforestation, drawing on successful strategies from his previous terms. These past initiatives saw the most significant reduction in Amazon deforestation rates in history, offering a beacon of hope for the potential impact of renewed efforts.\nCentral to Lula’s environmental policy is the fight against deforestation, which he has positioned as a cornerstone of Brazil’s contribution to the global battle against climate change. The Amazon rainforest, often dubbed the “lungs of the Earth,” plays a crucial role in carbon absorption, making its protection essential for mitigating global warming.\nFrom Sao Paulo comes encouraging news: deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest fell 30% in February from a year earlier, according to government data. This significant decrease, as reported by the space research agency INPE, indicates that 226 square kilometers of the rainforest were cleared last month—a noteworthy reduction from the record 322 square kilometers deforested in the same period last year. Although these figures remain above the nine-year average for February, the downward trend in deforestation under Lula’s government marks a pivotal shift towards fulfilling the pledge to end illegal deforestation by 2030.\nHowever, interpreting this data requires caution, particularly due to the heavy cloud cover over the rainforest early in the year, which can affect satellite readings. Additionally, a sharp spike in wildfires in the northernmost state of Roraima, threatening Indigenous communities in the Yanomami territory, underscores the complex challenges still facing Brazil’s environmental efforts.\nMoreover, concerns are rising over the deforestation of the Cerrado, one of the world’s most biodiverse savannas. WWF-Brasil’s strategy director Mariana Napolitano notes a drop in Amazon deforestation alongside an increase in Cerrado deforestation, highlighting the need for comprehensive environmental strategies that encompass all of Brazil’s unique ecosystems.\nLula’s comprehensive strategy includes a multi-faceted approach to protect the Amazon and its indigenous territories from illegal mining, logging, hunting, and fishing. Leveraging modern technology, such as intelligence and satellite imagery, the plan aims to monitor and track criminal activities threatening the forest’s integrity. Additionally, the introduction of economic incentives for conservation and a tracing system for products exported from the Amazon will ensure they are not sourced from deforested areas.\nThe road ahead is challenging, with climate scientists warning of the need for extensive reforestation efforts to protect the Amazon from reaching a tipping point. Yet, the early successes of Lula’s renewed efforts offer a glimmer of hope. As Brazil strides towards its goal of ending deforestation by 2030, the nation not only works to restore the health of its own precious rainforest but also contributes significantly to the global fight against climate change.\nAs the world watches, Lula’s administration embarks on this ambitious journey, the success of which could prove instrumental in the global effort to tackle climate change. The revitalization of the Amazon and the protection of its invaluable biodiversity represent not just a national commitment but a vital contribution to the health and stability of our planet.\nReference: Brazilian Ministry of the Environment WWF-Brasil Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) Reuters.

Their narratives did more than highlight the plant itself; they shone a light on a venerable practice—utilizing jute as a mulch, a technique that recalls a time before plastic became prevalent in farming.\nMulching stands as a guardian of soil health, a technique where the soil around plants is covered with a layer of material to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and maintain soil temperature. Its role in enhancing plant growth and soil structure is unparalleled.\nAmidst this backdrop, jute emerges as a protagonist. Biodegradable, sustainable, and enriching to the soil, jute as a mulching material is a testament to the ingenuity of traditional practices. As it decomposes, it feeds the soil, bridging the gap between past wisdom and future sustainability.\nThe revelation came through interviews with jute farmers for my thesis on jute policy. Their shared technique of using jute for mulching illustrated a sustainable approach deeply rooted in the fabric of their farming culture. This practice not only showcases an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic mulch but also aligns with global sustainability goals by reducing dependency on non-renewable resources.\nAs we look towards a more sustainable future in agriculture, embracing jute for mulching reminds us of the value in traditional practices.

Its effects, such as extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in rainfall patterns, pose a significant threat to human well-being and the environment. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) is a framework that seeks to address the impacts of climate change by using the natural systems and services provided by ecosystems to build resilience and promote sustainable development.\nEBA recognizes that ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, and oceans, provide essential services that can help us adapt to the impacts of climate change. For example, forests can protect against soil erosion, regulate water flows, and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Wetlands can act as natural buffers against flooding and storm surges, and provide habitat for biodiversity. By working with and supporting these natural systems, we can build resilience to the impacts of climate change.\nEBA is based on the principles of sustainable development and seeks to balance the needs of humans with the health and well-being of ecosystems. This means that EBA strategies must be designed with a long-term view that considers the needs of future generations. In addition, EBA recognizes that different ecosystems provide different services and that these services may be more important in certain areas or for certain communities.\nThere are many examples of EBA in practice around the world. For example, in Indonesia, the restoration of mangrove forests is being used to protect coastal communities from storm surges and sea level rise. In the United States, the restoration of wetlands in Louisiana is being used to protect against flooding and support the fishing industry. In Mexico, the restoration of forests is being used to protect against soil erosion and support local communities.\nEBA is not a silver bullet, and it cannot address all the impacts of climate change. However, it is an important part of the toolkit for building resilience and promoting sustainable development. By working with and supporting the natural systems and services provided by ecosystems, we can adapt to the impacts of climate change in a way that is sustainable, equitable, and effective.\n","date":1675987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675987200,"objectID":"37e343e9c5babf8c72a2be8936feb343","permalink":"https://example.com/post/eba/","publishdate":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/eba/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses about a brief study of IPCC Report 2022","tags":null,"title":"Ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"Music has long been associated with various health benefits, such as improving mental health, reducing stress and anxiety, and enhancing overall well-being.

The rise of fast fashion has had a significant impact on the environment, from the production of clothing to its disposal. In this blog, we will explore the impact of fast fashion on the environment and what we can do to mitigate its effects.\nProduction\nThe production of fast fashion has a significant impact on the environment. The clothing industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world. The production of clothing involves the use of water, energy, and chemicals. According to the United Nations, the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions, and it is the second-largest consumer of water in the world.\nThe production of cotton, one of the most widely used fabrics in clothing production, requires a significant amount of water. The production of synthetic fabrics, such as polyester, also requires a significant amount of energy and the use of chemicals. The production of clothing also generates waste, with textile waste accounting for around 5% of all landfill space in the US.\nTransportation\nThe transportation of clothing also has an impact on the environment. The majority of clothing is produced in developing countries, such as China and Bangladesh, and then shipped to developed countries for sale. This transportation requires significant amounts of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\nDisposal\nThe disposal of fast fashion also has a significant impact on the environment. Clothing that is not recycled or reused is often sent to landfills, where it can take decades to decompose. The dyes and chemicals used in clothing production can leach into the soil and groundwater, polluting the environment.\nWhat can we do to mitigate the impact of fast fashion?\nBuy fewer clothes: One of the simplest ways to reduce the impact of fast fashion is to buy fewer clothes. Instead of buying new clothes every season, consider investing in high-quality pieces that will last for years. Buy second-hand: Buying second-hand clothing is an excellent way to reduce the demand for new clothing. Second-hand clothing stores, online marketplaces, and clothing swaps are all great places to find gently used clothing at a fraction of the cost of new clothing.\nChoose sustainable materials: Look for clothing made from sustainable materials, such as organic cotton, hemp, and recycled materials. These materials have a lower impact on the environment and are often more durable than synthetic fabrics.\nSupport sustainable fashion brands: There are many sustainable fashion brands that are committed to producing clothing in an environmentally friendly way. Supporting these brands helps to reduce the demand for fast fashion and promotes sustainable practices in the industry.\nIn conclusion, fast fashion has had a significant impact on the environment, from the production of clothing to its disposal. By buying fewer clothes, buying second-hand, choosing sustainable materials, and supporting sustainable fashion brands, we can all play a part in mitigating the impact of fast fashion on the environment.\n","date":1675728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675728000,"objectID":"7a05578d4226033262f2cf4b6acda648","permalink":"https://example.com/post/fashion/","publishdate":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/fashion/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses the impact of fast fashion on environment","tags":null,"title":"Impact of Fast Fashion on Environment","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"The world is facing a significant challenge when it comes to energy. The traditional forms of energy such as fossil fuels are limited, and the need for alternative energy sources has become more critical than ever. One of the most promising alternatives is saltwater power. Saltwater power is a clean, renewable source of energy that is both abundant and accessible. One of the most exciting applications of saltwater power is in the form of a saltwater power lamp. In this blog, we will explore what a saltwater power lamp is, how it works, and its benefits.\nA saltwater power lamp is a unique lamp that uses salt water to generate electricity. The lamp works by harnessing the chemical reaction when saltwater is mixed with magnesium. When magnesium comes into contact with salt water, it creates a chemical reaction that produces electricity. This electricity is then used to power the lamp.\nA saltwater power lamp works through a process called electrolysis. When magnesium is placed in saltwater, it begins to corrode, and the reaction between the magnesium and the saltwater produces a flow of electrons. These electrons can be harnessed and used to power the lamp.\nThe lamp comprises two electrodes: a magnesium electrode and a copper electrode. These two electrodes are placed in the saltwater, and the reaction between the magnesium and the saltwater produces electricity. The copper electrode is connected to the lamp, and the magnesium electrode is connected to a copper wire that extends above the saltwater. The copper wire is used to switch the lamp on and off.\nOne of the most significant benefits of a saltwater power lamp is that it is a clean, renewable energy source. Saltwater is abundant and readily available, and the process of generating electricity from saltwater is entirely pollution-free. This makes saltwater power an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional forms of energy.\nAnother benefit of a saltwater power lamp is that it is straightforward to use. The lamp does not require any batteries or an external power source. All that is needed is salt water and a magnesium electrode. The lamp can be used anywhere, making it an excellent option for camping, emergencies, or anywhere where electricity is not readily available.\nLastly, a saltwater power lamp is incredibly cost-effective. The materials needed to create a saltwater power lamp are inexpensive and readily available. This makes it an affordable alternative to traditional lamps, which require expensive batteries or an external power source.\nIn conclusion, a saltwater power lamp is an innovative and exciting application of saltwater power. It is a clean, renewable source of energy that is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The lamp is straightforward to use and can be used anywhere, making it an excellent option for emergencies, camping, or anywhere where electricity is not readily available. The future of energy lies in alternative sources, and saltwater power is a promising and exciting option.\n","date":1675641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675641600,"objectID":"3918c6a6d7357867235be118bce5c1be","permalink":"https://example.com/post/saltwater-power-lamp/","publishdate":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/saltwater-power-lamp/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses about Sustainable Innovation","tags":null,"title":"Saltwater Power Lamp","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"GRI is an independent, international organization that helps businesses and other organizations take responsibility for their impacts by providing them with a global common language to communicate those impacts through GRI standards.

These include long-term perspectives and links between environmental, social, and economic challenges.\nThe discussion of organizational-level yearly reporting has also been expanded to include sustainability issues. In large parts of the world, publishing an annual report on financial performance is mandated by law for private and public institutions. It is given systematically and includes all pertinent financial data. To give the client of the accounts reasonable confidence regarding its completeness and correctness, and, in the public sector, to certify to the proper financial responsibility of the audited institution, a financial report or financial statement is often audited by an external auditor.\nEven though financial data may not provide a comprehensive picture of a business and the environment in which it works, corporate decision-making sometimes relies significantly on it. An organization’s success is influenced by various factors, like its ability to minimize greenhouse emissions or the effective use of its resources, in addition to its financial performance. Environmental and sustainability concerns are not simply morally troubling; they also have a growing economic relevance. Another illustration of how a company might behave is to preserve customer and staff happiness. These instances illustrate how corporate governance in the commercial sector and sound governance in the public sector are becoming increasingly important. Traditional financial reporting cannot be used to report these problems alone. Some organizations have begun to publish their performance on environmental concerns, social responsibility, or sustainable development in addition to financial issues to give a broader view of their performance.\nIn the coming Blogs, I will discuss five international sustainability reporting frameworks that is CDP, GRI, SASB, IIRC, TCFD\n","date":1674864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674864000,"objectID":"5b540b1d7c56aa99c28375c16774c703","permalink":"https://example.com/post/international-sustainable-reporting-/","publishdate":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/international-sustainable-reporting-/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses the sustainable reporting","tags":null,"title":"International Sustainability Reporting Framework","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"Ecotourism is ethical travel to natural regions that preserves the environment, supports the welfare of the local community, and includes interpretation and education. Outdoor recreation, such as hiking, skiing, and camping, is a new culture nowadays. Additionally, the physical activity and health value that result from outdoor recreation can be considered important benefits of forests. Not only is there evidence that nature improves physical well-being, but it can benefit humans both psychologically and spiritually. It has been noted that many individuals consider “the forest” as a “symbolic and self-directed entity without referring to a specific place”.This emphasizes the emotional and spiritual connection humans have with forests and their importance to their well-being. Tourists visit forests for both physical and mental experiences. Therefore, it is very important to think about ecotourism and how to make it more sustainable.\nEcotourism is a significant economic and educational endeavor when done properly. It has the potential to connect to a larger audience and foster conservation support while educating the general public about the value and fragility of such ecosystems. Additionally, it encourages the non-consumptive use of wilderness areas for the benefit of nearby populations that rely on these delicate environments. It entails traveling to scenic locations, which offers respite from the stressful artificial world and a momentary reprieve from the pollution of big cities. When individuals personally engage with nature, it inspires a feeling of their conservation on a personal level and fosters environmental consciousness among the tourists. It draws attention to regional and tribal traditions and fosters respect for these lesser-known cultures. Ecotourism creates jobs, offers financial help, and strengthens the local community.

In rural areas, jute leaf is also known as nailya leaf. But that jute leaf was mainly obtained from Tosha or Baghi jute. In addition to being low in calories, jute leaves also contain many vital vitamins and minerals, such as iron, riboflavin, folate, and vitamins A and C. It is reported that Cleopatra the Egyptian queen consumed jute leaves to maintain the health of her skin.\nLet’s discuss some of the benefits of consuming jute leaf: Cure Constipation: Jute leaves are rich in fiber. Moreover, fiber is very effective in maintaining good bowel movements.\nReduce inflammation: Omega-3 fatty acids are found in jute leaves, which reduce inflammation. These fatty acids aid in reducing body inflammation. Additionally, the antioxidant “Lycopene” found in jute leaves aids in regenerating cells harmed by oxidation. Boost immunity: Vitamin C-rich jute leaves might strengthen the immune system. Additionally, vitamin C functions as a potent antioxidant that lessens the negative effects of stress, pollution, and cell oxidation. Eye and skin care: Vitamin A in jute leaves is good for the eyes and skin. Additionally, vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the youthfulness of the skin’s “epithelial” cells. Cure for Restless Leg Syndrome: A person suffering from this disease keeps moving their legs constantly. One of the causes of this illness is a deficiency in iron in the body. Jute leaf consumption is frequently suggested as a natural treatment for this illness. As jute leaf is one of the rich sources of iron.

Biochar, in a nutshell, is the carbon-rich byproduct of heating biomass, such as wood, manure, or leaves, in a closed container with little to no available air. One of the earliest industrial technologies created by humans is the manufacturing of charcoal, which is frequently reflected in this procedure. Because there are so many different types of biomass and charring circumstances, it is considerably more challenging to define biochar from a chemical standpoint than it is from a production standpoint. The word “char” is frequently used synonymously with “charcoal,” although it is also occasionally used to describe materials that have undergone less extensive charring than charcoal. Advantages of biochar:\nBiochar is a carbon-rich, stable solid that can withstand thousands of years in soil. The enormous amounts of animal dung that are produced can be disposed of using biochar. The hygroscopic nature of biochar allows it to take in and retain water from its surroundings. It is therefore the perfect soil material for areas with frequent water shortages. In addition to boosting agricultural output and protecting against several foliar and soil-borne diseases, biochar increases the soil fertility of acidic soils. Potentially, fossil fuels might be replaced by the heat energy generated during the synthesis of biochar. If biochar is found to be a useful resource, it might significantly enhance air quality and help reverse the consequences of climate change. Large amounts of hazardous gases are released into the environment when biomass is burned or naturally decomposed. Biochar similarly releases the same gases into the atmosphere, but the carbon content is constant.

These systems produce 13% carbon dioxide, 44% methane, and 82% nitrous oxide emissions. We cannot expect agriculture to stay resilient, and as a result, the farming system urgently needs to reform. At this point, a different farming method known as “Permaculture” was developed in the 1970s by Australian biologist Bill Mollison and his student David Holmgren.\nThe goal of permaculture is to create long-lasting productive systems and sustainable communities that reduce the use of non-renewable energy and regulate ecological cycles. Earth care, people care, and a fair share are the three pillars of permaculture. It requires a methodical strategy based on the local environment to ensure that any systemic changes have no negative effects on the planet or its inhabitants.\nTo adopt permaculture, we have to understand the type of the landscape, the way the water flows, the animals and trees there, and the state of the land are all made clear to us by this. It includes planning for infrastructure, a master plan, and where housing communities are located and how vegetation is grown. Methods used for this include topographical research, sound mapping, bird and tree counts, hydrological surveys, etc.\nThe practice of permaculture has its own special obstacles, just like any other agricultural method. Large landscapes, for example, may have different outcomes in various locations depending on how well the ecosystem is maintained there. Additionally, there is a need to motivate farmers to abandon chemical use in favor of soil conservation and restoration. Therefore, the largest issue is to comprehend and enhance the environment before deciding on food production.\n","date":1666483200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666483200,"objectID":"2d87a7fc3bbdd597502b38008362cbf7","permalink":"https://example.com/post/permaculture/","publishdate":"2022-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/permaculture/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses about permaculture","tags":null,"title":"Permaculture - Remodeling agriculture system","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"Sustainability reporting, in the business world, refers to the disclosure of non-financial performance data to external parties of the organization, whether voluntarily, upon request, or as a requirement.

Stop there! can you believe that you can grow your food in a vase that is kept near you? Agriculture has developed so much that we can think of a world without soil. In the current situation, farmers are doing intensive agriculture and the consequence is poor soil health. Therefore, to improve the deteriorating condition of soil health we need another alternative medium for growing plants.\nTo overcome constraints like water availability, small land holdings, disease, pest incidence, problematic soils, etc., Hydroponic techniques were innovated. Basic Requirements of Hydroponics: Growing media, Nutrient solution, Temperature, Air, Supporting materials, Water, Mineral nutrient, and Light.\nHydroponic crop production has significantly increased in recent years worldwide, as it allows more efficient use of water and fertilizers, off-season production, and better control of climate and pest factors. Furthermore, hydroponic production increases crop quality and productivity, which results in higher competitiveness and economic growth. All essential nutrients are supplied to hydroponic plants in the form of nutrient solution, which consists of fertilizer salts dissolved in water. This garden is less dirty than a normal garden because it does not require soil. As a result, there will be no thought of cleaning or killing plant insects. The main source of food for these garden plants is water and water nutrients. In such a garden, water and necessary nutrients will be provided at the root of the plant, so that the plant will survive day after day and grow quickly. Let’s take a look at some types of hydroponic gardens.\nWick System: This type of gardening is done over a water reservoir with coconut husks or perlite (small stones). Coconut coir or perlite here draws water and supplies it to the plant roots. Reservoir water provides essential nutrients to plants. Drip System: This system requires only a small pump and a timer. Water flows through the drip line at the base of the plant. When the roots of the tree are dry, the timer will give the signal to run the pump. Once the pump starts running, the nutrient solution will reach the roots of the plant. Aeroponic system: In this case, the plant roots are dependent on air. The nutrient solution is applied to the plant’s root through continuous misting. Nutrient Film Technique: Plants are grown in large channels where there is a regular supply of water. A timer and pump are required to keep the water flowing. Ebb and flow system: In this method, small stones are placed in a tray, and nutrient-rich water is fed into it. Trey’s plant then gets its food from that water. The most successful plant grown in hydroponic techniques is leafy greens, herbs, strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes, spinach, radish, etc. ","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"334f48a31bca0d193e3e4bc353ed4c10","permalink":"https://example.com/post/hydroponics/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hydroponics/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses about hydroponics","tags":null,"title":"Hydroponics","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"The majority of population growth during the next forty years is anticipated to occur in cities, where more than half of the world’s population already resides. Most but not all studies have found that having access to green space in cities is linked to better health overall, including advantages for both physical and emotional well-being. Access to green space has been related to reduced physiological and psychological stress levels as well as cognitive repair. Researchers found that levels of environmental pollution increase the risk of stroke. There is now a new treatment to lower the risk of stroke. People who live close to green spaces, deep forests, and other natural settings are less likely to suffer from strokes. A Spanish research team discovered a connection between stroke propensity and a person’s proximity to a forest. According to their medical study, those who lived close to a forest were less likely to suffer a stroke. How come, though? Although it is impossible to know for sure, scientists think that being in touch with nature has numerous benefits for maintaining excellent bodily and mental health. Having plants nearby is crucial for maintaining good mental health and lowering stress. Additionally, individuals are more likely to stroll, which is good for the body, if there is a garden nearby.

These knowledge systems ensure the survival of the human race by preserving the environment, guaranteeing food security, and providing early warning systems for catastrophic risk management. Indigenous knowledge is valued by the impoverished as social capital and is crucial for ensuring survival and food production. The invasion of development notions, which promise sustainable development goals or solutions, is causing the progressive extinction of local knowledge.

You won’t get its taste anywhere else. This is why Darjeeling tea is also called the ‘champagne of tea’. But the condition of this tea is still deteriorating. Darjeeling tea is fighting for its existence in the world market.\nAccording to the report, half of the tea gardens in Darjeeling are on the verge of getting sold. Due to the rising wages of labourers, falling demand for tea and prices put Darjeeling tea in trouble. Let’s find out why such a crisis has arisen in front of Darjeeling tea.\nYes, the production of Darjeeling tea has not decreased, but its buyers and value have decreased. The main reason for this is the recession. It has been observed that Europe is the main market for Darjeeling tea exports. But the situation there is getting worse. The Russia-Ukraine war has thrown European countries into disarray. Due to this, the demand for Darjeeling tea is decreasing and the tea growers are facing huge problems.\nLabor and union protests are a common occurrence in tea gardens. It affects production as well as exports. The protests tarnished the image of Darjeeling tea gardens in the world. Some countries have reduced the demand for Darjeeling tea due to this. Among them, the most prominent name in Japan.\nAnother well-known name in the Darjeeling tea industry is Japan. But Japan has reduced its demand. This is because of the Gorkhaland protests of 2017, which stopped tea work for about 100 days. In these difficult days, Japan shifted its focus from Darjeeling tea to Nepal.\nNepal has emerged as a major tea market for many countries. Nepalese tea has already become famous both in import and export. As a result, Darjeeling tea’s production and sale suffered greatly.\nThe tea plantations here are continuously running on losses due to reduced demand for Darjeeling tea from Europe and Japan. There are reports of inferior tea being sold from Nepal and premium tea being re-exported from Darjeeling.\nChanges in government regulations have also had an impact. In 2003, the government refused to give GI tags to any imported tea. In November 2021, the Tea Board issued a notification banning the distribution of second-class imported tea in the domestic market.\nThrough this, the Bengal government allowed tea tourism in 15 percent of the tea plantations. Because of this, the local tea sellers are preparing to set up a resort on the tea garden land. For this, tea plantation land is being developed according to tea tourism.\n","date":1666224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666224000,"objectID":"91a246d9c837903b888e4ca14d749153","permalink":"https://example.com/post/tea/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tea/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses the decline of Darjeeling tea production","tags":null,"title":"Where is my cup of Darjeeling tea?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"A geographical indicator (GI) is a label placed on goods that come from a certain area and have characteristics or a reputation that are specific to that area of origin. A sign must specify that a product is from a specific location in order for it to serve as a GI. Furthermore, the origin of the product should be largely responsible for its attributes, traits, or reputation. There is an obvious connection between the product and its original site of production because the attributes are dependent on the geographic location of production. A geographical indicator right permits the owner of the right to use the indication to stop a third party from using it to market a product that doesn’t meet the relevant criteria.

Agriculture, handicrafts, food, wine \u0026amp; spirits, and industrial products are among the common categories for which geographic indications are utilised. In general, geographical indications are protected in various national and regional systems utilising a wide range of strategies, frequently combining two or more of the strategies (1. sui generis systems (i.e. special regimes of protection); 2. using collective or certification marks; and 3. methods focusing on business practices, including administrative product approval schemes).

It refers to the ability of humans to meet their present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is often broken down into three pillars: environmental, social, and economic. In this blog, we will explore these three pillars and how they work together to create a sustainable future.\nThe first pillar of sustainability is environmental sustainability. This refers to the ability of the natural environment to support life on Earth. Environmental sustainability involves preserving and protecting the planet’s natural resources, including land, air, water, and biodiversity. This can include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving energy, protecting ecosystems, and reducing waste.\nThe second pillar of sustainability is social sustainability. This refers to the ability of society to meet the needs of its members, including access to education, healthcare, and basic human rights. Social sustainability involves promoting social justice, equity, and inclusion, and addressing social issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination.\nThe third pillar of sustainability is economic sustainability. This refers to the ability of the economy to provide for the needs of the present and future generations. Economic sustainability involves promoting sustainable economic growth, creating jobs, and providing access to basic needs such as food, water, and shelter. This can include promoting sustainable business practices, reducing waste, and investing in renewable energy sources.\nIt is important to note that these three pillars of sustainability are interconnected and interdependent. Environmental sustainability is essential for social and economic sustainability, as healthy ecosystems provide the resources needed for human societies and economies to thrive. Social sustainability is important for economic sustainability, as a stable and equitable society provides the foundation for sustainable economic growth. Economic sustainability is important for environmental sustainability, as a sustainable economy can provide the resources needed to invest in environmental conservation and protection.\nIn conclusion, sustainability is a concept that encompasses environmental, social, and economic sustainability. These three pillars are interconnected and interdependent, and all are essential for creating a sustainable future. By promoting sustainable practices in all aspects of life, we can work towards a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for all.\n","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"1261223eda6a7017b0e91a12d4f8327d","permalink":"https://example.com/post/basics-of-sustainability-copy/","publishdate":"2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/basics-of-sustainability-copy/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses the the basics of sustainability","tags":["Sustainability"],"title":"Understanding the basics of sustainability - A beginner's guide to the three pillars of sustainability and how they work together.","type":"post"}]

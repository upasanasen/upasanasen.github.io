Stop there! can you believe that you can grow your own food in a vase that is kept near you? To overcome constraints like water availability, small land holdings, disease, pest incidence, problematic soils, etc., one of the most favored systems or technology highlighted currently is “Hydroponics”.Hydroponic crop production has significantly increased in recent years worldwide, as it allows more efficient use of water and fertilizers, as well as better control of climate and pest factors. Furthermore, hydroponic production increases crop quality and productivity, which results in higher competitiveness and economic growth. Basic Requirements of Hydroponics: Growing media, Nutrient solution, Temperature, Air, Supporting materials, Water, Mineral nutrient, and Light. All essential nutrients are supplied to hydroponic plants in the form of nutrient solution, which consists of fertilizer salts dissolved in water. This garden is less dirty than a normal garden because it does not require soil. As a result, there will be no thought of cleaning or killing plant insects if you do this gardening at home. It will take up less space. The main source of food for these garden plants is water and water nutrients. In such a garden, water and necessary nutrients will be provided at the root of the tree, so that the tree will survive day after day and grow quickly. Let’s take a look at some types of hydroponic gardens. Only then will the matter be clear. Wick System: This type of gardening is done over a water reservoir with coconut husks or perlite (small stones). Coconut coir or perlite here draws water and supplies it to the plant roots. Reservoir water provides essential nutrients to plants. Drip System: This system requires only a small pump and a timer. Water flows through the drip line at the base of the plant. When the roots of the tree are dry, the timer will give the signal to run the pump. Once the pump starts running, the nutrient solution will reach the roots of the plant. Aeroponic system: In this case, the plant roots are dependent on air. The nutrient solution is applied to the root of the plant through continuous misting. A good spray should be given in this method. Nutrient Film Technique: Plants are grown in large channels where there is a regular supply of water. A timer and pump are required to keep the water flowing. Ebb and flow system: In this method, small stones are placed in a tray, and nutrient-rich water is fed into it. Trey’s plant then gets its food from that water.\n","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"334f48a31bca0d193e3e4bc353ed4c10","permalink":"https://example.com/post/hydroponics/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hydroponics/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses about hydroponics","tags":null,"title":"Hydroponics","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"One of Bengal’s primary crops is jute. In rural areas, jute leaf is also known as nailya leaf. But that jute leaf was mainly obtained from Tosha or Baghi jute. In addition to being low in calories, jute leaves also contain many vital vitamins and minerals, such as iron, riboflavin, folate, and vitamins A and C. It is reported that Cleopatra the Egyptian queen consumed jute leaves to maintain the health of her skin.\nLet’s discuss some of the benefits of consuming jute leaf: Cure Constipation: Jute leaves are rich in fiber. Moreover, fiber is very effective in maintaining good bowel movements.\nReduce inflammation: Omega-3 fatty acids are found in jute leaves, which reduce inflammation. These fatty acids aid in reducing body inflammation. Additionally, the antioxidant “Lycopene” found in jute leaves aids in regenerating cells harmed by oxidation. Boost immunity: Vitamin C-rich jute leaves might strengthen the immune system. Additionally, vitamin C functions as a potent antioxidant that lessens the negative effects of stress, pollution, and cell oxidation. Eye and skin care: Vitamin A in jute leaves is good for the eyes and skin. Additionally, vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the youthfulness of the skin’s “epithelial” cells. Cure for Restless Leg Syndrome: A person suffering from this disease keeps moving their legs constantly. One of the causes of this illness is a deficiency in iron in the body. Jute leaf consumption is frequently suggested as a natural treatment for this illness. As jute leaf is one of the rich sources of iron.

Mycelium, a component that resembles a thread, makes up a portion of the fungus’s body. According to experts, this mycelium leather will be significantly more durable than regular leather. Additionally, any shape can be selected while creating this skin, eliminating waste when using it. Additionally, according to researchers, this leather will lessen the need for plastic and synthetic fibres in the future. As a result, the planet will be spared from the environmental damage that plastic does. Air pollution is another adverse effect of the leather business. It. Will help use to avail vegan-friendly material and reduce air pollution. Although this invention has a lot of potential, there are some issues with it. Economically speaking, it is incredibly expensive to produce this fungus leather. As a result, only a few exclusive and pricey fashion companies can afford it. Anyways, there is currently no mass production system. Scientists are hopeful that these issues can be resolved swiftly with the help of advance scientific approach. Overall, this discovery is genuinely groundbreaking, but it won’t be clear until later how well its direct applications will work.\n","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"aeb5d365d9b2ab8f639bf7195eebe0d9","permalink":"https://example.com/post/mushroom/","publishdate":"2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mushroom/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses sustainable textile","tags":null,"title":"Let's wear Mushroom","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"The majority of population growth during the next forty years is anticipated to occur in cities, where more than half of the world’s population already resides. Most but not all studies have found that having access to green space in cities is linked to better health overall, including advantages for both physical and emotional well-being. Access to green space has been related to reduced physiological and psychological stress levels as well as cognitive repair. Researchers found that levels of environmental pollution increase the risk of stroke. There is now a new treatment to lower the risk of stroke. People who live close to green spaces, deep forests, and other natural settings are less likely to suffer from strokes. A Spanish research team discovered a connection between stroke propensity and a person’s proximity to a forest. According to their medical study, those who lived close to a forest were less likely to suffer a stroke. How come, though? Although it is impossible to know for sure, scientists think that being in touch with nature has numerous benefits for maintaining excellent bodily and mental health. Having plants nearby is crucial for maintaining good mental health and lowering stress. Additionally, individuals are more likely to stroll, which is good for the body, if there is a garden nearby. Furthermore, more greenery reduces pollution.\n","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"45044be186ba46ce43e5af2c1ff24a3d","permalink":"https://example.com/post/stoke/","publishdate":"2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/stoke/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses how planting green can help cure disease","tags":null,"title":"The cure to the deadly disease - Stroke","type":"post"},{"authors":["Upasana Sen"],"categories":null,"content":"The story of Darjeeling tea is unique. You won’t get its taste anywhere else. This is why Darjeeling tea is also called the ‘champagne of tea’. But the condition of this tea is still deteriorating. Darjeeling tea is fighting for its existence in the world market.\nAccording to the report, half of the tea gardens in Darjeeling are on the verge of getting sold. Due to the rising wages of labourers, falling demand for tea and prices put Darjeeling tea in trouble. Let’s find out why such a crisis has arisen in front of Darjeeling tea.\nYes, the production of Darjeeling tea has not decreased, but its buyers and value have decreased. The main reason for this is the recession. It has been observed that Europe is the main market for Darjeeling tea exports. But the situation there is getting worse. The Russia-Ukraine war has thrown European countries into disarray. Due to this, the demand for Darjeeling tea is decreasing and the tea growers are facing huge problems.\nLabor and union protests are a common occurrence in tea gardens. It affects production as well as exports. The protests tarnished the image of Darjeeling tea gardens in the world. Some countries have reduced the demand for Darjeeling tea due to this. Among them, the most prominent name in Japan.\nAnother well-known name in the Darjeeling tea industry is Japan. But Japan has reduced its demand. This is because of the Gorkhaland protests of 2017, which stopped tea work for about 100 days. In these difficult days, Japan shifted its focus from Darjeeling tea to Nepal.\nNepal has emerged as a major tea market for many countries. Nepalese tea has already become famous both in import and export. As a result, Darjeeling tea’s production and sale suffered greatly.\nThe tea plantations here are continuously running on losses due to reduced demand for Darjeeling tea from Europe and Japan. There are reports of inferior tea being sold from Nepal and premium tea being re-exported from Darjeeling.\nChanges in government regulations have also had an impact. In 2003, the government refused to give GI tags to any imported tea. In November 2021, the Tea Board issued a notification banning the distribution of second-class imported tea in the domestic market.\nThrough this, the Bengal government allowed tea tourism in 15 percent of the tea plantations. Because of this, the local tea sellers are preparing to set up a resort on the tea garden land. For this, tea plantation land is being developed according to tea tourism.\n","date":1666137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666137600,"objectID":"91a246d9c837903b888e4ca14d749153","permalink":"https://example.com/post/tea/","publishdate":"2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tea/","section":"post","summary":"This post discusses the decline of Darjeeling tea production","tags":null,"title":"Where is my cup of Darjeeling tea?","type":"post"}]

  <h1>What Sustainability Actually Means in 2026</h1>
  <p><em>Published: March 1, 2026</em></p>

  <p>Sustainability in 2026 is no longer a symbolic act. It has become an engineering discipline.</p>

  <h2>The shift</h2>
  <p>Companies are no longer asking whether they should reduce emissions. They are asking how to optimize carbon, energy, and infrastructure using intelligent systems.</p>

  <h2>AI’s role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Predicting energy demand</li>
    <li>Optimizing supply chains</li>
    <li>Reducing waste before it exists</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This represents a shift from reactive sustainability to predictive sustainability.</p>

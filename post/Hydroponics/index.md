Whenever you think of agriculture you imagine a land filled with green. Stop there! can you believe that you can grow your own food in a vase that is kept near you? 
To overcome constraints like water availability, small land holdings, disease, pest incidence, problematic soils, etc., one of the most favored systems or technology highlighted currently is ‚ÄúHydroponics‚Äù.Hydroponic crop production has significantly increased in recent years worldwide, as it allows more efficient use of water and fertilizers, as well as better control of climate and pest factors. Furthermore, hydroponic production increases crop quality and productivity, which results in higher competitiveness and economic growth. Basic Requirements of Hydroponics: Growing media, Nutrient solution, Temperature, Air, Supporting materials, Water, Mineral nutrient, and Light. All essential nutrients are supplied to hydroponic plants in the form of nutrient solution, which consists of fertilizer salts dissolved in water. 
This garden is less dirty than a normal garden because it does not require soil. As a result, there will be no thought of cleaning or killing plant insects if you do this gardening at home. It will take up less space. The main source of food for these garden plants is water and water nutrients. In such a garden, water and necessary nutrients will be provided at the root of the tree, so that the tree will survive day after day and grow quickly. Let's take a look at some types of hydroponic gardens. Only then will the matter be clear.
`Wick System`: This type of gardening is done over a water reservoir with coconut husks or perlite (small stones). Coconut coir or perlite here draws water and supplies it to the plant roots. Reservoir water provides essential nutrients to plants.
`Drip System`: This system requires only a small pump and a timer. Water flows through the drip line at the base of the plant. When the roots of the tree are dry, the timer will give the signal to run the pump. Once the pump starts running, the nutrient solution will reach the roots of the plant.
`Aeroponic system`: In this case, the plant roots are dependent on air. The nutrient solution is applied to the root of the plant through continuous misting. A good spray should be given in this method.
`Nutrient Film Technique`: Plants are grown in large channels where there is a regular supply of water. A timer and pump are required to keep the water flowing.
Ebb and flow system: In this method, small stones are placed in a tray, and nutrient-rich water is fed into it. Trey's plant then gets its food from that water.

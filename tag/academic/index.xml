      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Bengal&amp;rsquo;s primary crops is jute. In rural areas, jute leaf is also known as nailya leaf. But that jute leaf was mainly obtained from Tosha or Baghi jute. In addition to being low in calories, jute leaves also contain many vital vitamins and minerals, such as iron, riboflavin, folate, and vitamins A and C. It is reported that Cleopatra the Egyptian queen consumed jute leaves to maintain the health of her skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss some of the benefits of consuming jute leaf:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Reduce inflammation&lt;/code&gt;: Omega-3 fatty acids are found in jute leaves, which reduce inflammation. These fatty acids aid in reducing body inflammation. Additionally, the antioxidant &amp;ldquo;Lycopene&amp;rdquo; found in jute leaves aids in regenerating cells harmed by oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Boost immunity&lt;/code&gt;: Vitamin C-rich jute leaves might strengthen the immune system. Additionally, vitamin C functions as a potent antioxidant that lessens the negative effects of stress, pollution, and cell oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Eye and skin care&lt;/code&gt;: Vitamin A in jute leaves is good for the eyes and skin. Additionally, vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the youthfulness of the skin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;epithelial&amp;rdquo; cells.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TThe majority of population growth during the next forty years is anticipated to occur in cities, where more than half of the world&amp;rsquo;s population already resides. Most but not all studies have found that having access to green space in cities is linked to better health overall, including advantages for both physical and emotional well-being. Access to green space has been related to reduced physiological and psychological stress levels as well as cognitive repair.
Researchers found that levels of environmental pollution increase the risk of stroke. There is now a new treatment to lower the risk of stroke. People who live close to green spaces, deep forests, and other natural settings are less likely to suffer from strokes.
A Spanish research team discovered a connection between stroke propensity and a person&amp;rsquo;s proximity to a forest. According to their medical study, those who lived close to a forest were less likely to suffer a stroke. How come, though? Although it is impossible to know for sure, scientists think that being in touch with nature has numerous benefits for maintaining excellent bodily and mental health. Having plants nearby is crucial for maintaining good mental health and lowering stress. Additionally, individuals are more likely to stroll, which is good for the body, if there is a garden nearby. Furthermore, more greenery reduces pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where is my cup of Darjeeling tea?</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/tea/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Darjeeling tea is unique. You won&amp;rsquo;t get its taste anywhere else. This is why Darjeeling tea is also called the &amp;lsquo;champagne of tea&amp;rsquo;. But the condition of this tea is still deteriorating. Darjeeling tea is fighting for its existence in the world market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, half of the tea gardens in Darjeeling are on the verge of getting sold. Due to the rising wages of labourers, falling demand for tea and prices put Darjeeling tea in trouble. Let&amp;rsquo;s find out why such a crisis has arisen in front of Darjeeling tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the production of Darjeeling tea has not decreased, but its buyers and value have decreased. The main reason for this is the recession. It has been observed that Europe is the main market for Darjeeling tea exports. But the situation there is getting worse. The Russia-Ukraine war has thrown European countries into disarray. Due to this, the demand for Darjeeling tea is decreasing and the tea growers are facing huge problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor and union protests are a common occurrence in tea gardens. It affects production as well as exports. The protests tarnished the image of Darjeeling tea gardens in the world. Some countries have reduced the demand for Darjeeling tea due to this. Among them, the most prominent name in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another well-known name in the Darjeeling tea industry is Japan. But Japan has reduced its demand. This is because of the Gorkhaland protests of 2017, which stopped tea work for about 100 days. In these difficult days, Japan shifted its focus from Darjeeling tea to Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepal has emerged as a major tea market for many countries. Nepalese tea has already become famous both in import and export. As a result, Darjeeling tea&amp;rsquo;s production and sale suffered greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tea plantations here are continuously running on losses due to reduced demand for Darjeeling tea from Europe and Japan. There are reports of inferior tea being sold from Nepal and premium tea being re-exported from Darjeeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in government regulations have also had an impact. In 2003, the government refused to give GI tags to any imported tea. In November 2021, the Tea Board issued a notification banning the distribution of second-class imported tea in the domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this, the Bengal government allowed tea tourism in 15 percent of the tea plantations. Because of this, the local tea sellers are preparing to set up a resort on the tea garden land. For this, tea plantation land is being developed according to tea tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
